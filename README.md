# DNA Cloud


### Motive

This project is aimed at creating DNA encoding techniques using Cyclic Codes, Convolutional Codes and Reed Solomon codes. The user would need to input the file in .txt format and select the coding technique from the three techniques. The software would redirect to download the encoded file which can be downloaded in the selected folder. Similar process can be followed for decoding an already encoded text file.

### Codecs

The python implementation of all the codecs can be found in the **codes** subfolder of the **codec** folder.
